## Description:
    As a group, we wanted to create a small and fun choose your own adventure game similar
     to the goosebumps books but with a retro video game feel.  After creating a user, 
     you are prompted with choices. These choices change the possible outcomes of the game
      by either advancing you further along or making you start all over.

## User Story:
    As a user,
    I want to play a new web browser game
    When I load the page
    Then I create an account 
    When I advance the page
    Then I am presented with two choices
    When I choose correctly 
    Then I advance further into the game
    When I choose incorrectly
    Then the game is over, back to start
